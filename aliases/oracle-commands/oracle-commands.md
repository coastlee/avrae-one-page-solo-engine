A list of all the possible commands you can run with the oracle, as inspired by the One Page Solo Engine!

_ _

To learn more about individual commands, run `!help oracle <command name>`; i.e. `!help oracle plot` or `!help oracle`. Add `-here` to the command to have the output post in the channel you ran the command, rather than Avrae sending it to you via your DMs.
