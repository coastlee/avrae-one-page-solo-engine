Use GM Moves to move the action!

There are two types of GM Moves: Pacing and Failure.

- `!oracle pacing`
  - Use this when there's a lull in the action
- `!oracle failure`
  - Use this when you want to move things forward when the PCs fail a check

Use this if you want to see a bigger output that includes the table for reference and the generated dice rolls!

- `!oracle failure -v`
