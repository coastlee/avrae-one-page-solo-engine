When you need to create a **random event**, draw one each from the following:

- What happens: **Action Focus**
- The thing happening involves: **Topic Focus**.

You'll use this after rolling a **plot hook** (`!oracle plot`) and before **setting the scene** (`!oracle scene`).

- `!oracle event`
  - This gives you an idea for a random event!
- `!oracle event -v`
  - This will show the table and the rolls the oracle made!
