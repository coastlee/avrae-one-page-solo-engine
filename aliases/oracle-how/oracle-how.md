**Oracle How**

When you need to know how big, good, strong, numerous, etc. something is.


**Examples.** 

- `!oracle how many criminals are there around the corner?`
- `!oracle how hard is it going to be to climb this rock? -v`

Adding `-v` will show you oracle's roll and the table it's rolling on!
